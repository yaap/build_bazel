# Common target platforms for Android Platform builds.

#   - Hardware capabilities
#   - Firmware differences

# Platforms do NOT represent different software packages, that is the
# reposibility of the top-level targets being built.
#
# These model after the arch and OS definitions in build/soong/android/arch.go.
